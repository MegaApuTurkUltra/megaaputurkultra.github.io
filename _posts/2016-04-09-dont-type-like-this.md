Seriously. Don't.

- It's Against The Rules Of English Grammar
    - You Only Capitalize First Words Of Sentences And Proper Nouns
- It Makes You Look Bad
    - People Will Think You Don't Know English
- It **Doesn't** Look "Nice" Or "Good"; It Just Makes Everyone Super Annoyed To Have To Read Your Post
    - I Can't Even Read My Own Blog Post Now.

Just don't do it, please.
